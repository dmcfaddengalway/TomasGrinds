# Tips
* Up-Arrow -- use this to cycle through previous commands typed
* !! -- will run the last command, helpful if last one was very long and you dont feel like copy and pasting
* tab - type first few letters of folder and then tab and it should autocomplete
* drag & drop -- can drag and drop files for their path into the terminal
* Control-C -- used to cancel an operation, clears the line and makes new prompt for typing
